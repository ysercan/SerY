It reassures you that, yep, this will increase your sales, just as it did for Bill and Barbara.<br/><br/>The good: this is like looking though the eyes of The Corporation. The book will give you their take on why car companies shouldn't invest too much in seatbelts, why arbitration clauses are good, how you must avoid giving the impression of firing-with-cause, and so on. Not that you'll agree with (or should agree with) any of that, but, well, it's interesting to hear those points so clearly made.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Unfortunately I felt like that guy when I was reading this book.<br/><br/>There are only so many times I can read that time is like 'a river', or read a paragraph-length biography of someone's life in order to support their two sentences of historical contribution. The historical viewpoint, too, gives the story a sort of interrupted flow. Sure, it makes a lot of sense to 'start from the beginning' but I wish that the physical approaches (time as a field, as a measure of entropy, as relative or absolute) were enumerated rather than unveiled one by one, deep in mostly unnecessary context.<br/><br/>This might sound like a review written by some guy who heard about time travel and wants a time machine as soon as possible, with as little interference as possible. And maybe I've worn out my nonfiction reading ability by overdosing on these mile-deep scientific/literary history books. But anyway, Time Travel seemed, well, like a lackluster use of my time, a book that tried to be too much in and of itself and that never really developed into anything or built on itself, perhaps like our thinking about time travel itself.

I understand that history authors need to manufacture dialogue, but what he comes up with is chock-full of unbelievable cliches.

He starts with lots of biographical detail - too much, for my taste, since I don't particularly care whether Oppenheimer had a nice childhood. And then it transitions into a methodical explanation of the atomic experimentation and industry, and then finally into a decently robust argument for nuclear power. The first 80% is completely non-rhetorical, but you really feel it speed up and energize in the last 20%, and I was left wishing he had chosen one or the other.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

And it's passable, for the first few chapters. It takes a turn at Chapter 7. Maybe the copyeditor stopped there, or another author swapped in, and at that point the number of grammar and style errors skyrockets.

I read it after visiting the MJT, which I enjoyed greatly. I'm a fan, though I feel like it falls into the New Yorker trap of being too focused on the individual - we learn about Wilson's family, upbringing, habits, personality - but not enough about the ideas that he's trying to share. After all, this is a book about a relatively unique type of museum trying to send a message, and it would be interesting to also hear how this message is received and how it changes over the years.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There are one or two good notes, like pointing out how people often offer rewards they themselves would enjoy without considering the other party.<br/><br/>But besides that, it's absurd: there's a serious anti-intellectual bent combined with crazy culture (offering suggestions of what to do at ""the club""). Science and studies cited are loose, with guesstimated statistics. Although the observations about human nature - brutal realism of people as plastic, self-centered, and fragile creatures - are usually valid, their portrayal here make the follower of directions act without allowing people to rise above these expectations.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It doesn't swing predictably Republican, Democratic, or other, and it's on a refreshingly more macro level than the 'random walk' trend. Where other writers lean toward character judgments of the rich or the poor, Cowen tries to present the problem as more deeply-embedded, as a cyclical slowdown in mankind's progress itself.<br/><br/>He is oddly dismissive of the internet as a technology. It's true that job creation has revenue on the internet has been limited, but the examples in this book are thin and the language, which is otherwise nice and balanced, distills the internet down into a ""fun"" fad. His focus is heavily on media companies on the internet - wouldn't be more interesting to compare, say, Amazon to Wal-Mart?<br/><br/>All in all, it's a worth a read and I appreciate the pacing and brevity - it feels exactly as long as it should be.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Everyman's main character is at first almost relatable, but by the end of the book, there's a feeling that all of the sadness is entirely physical in nature - that he's caring so much about his body without any real plans of what to do with it, and without a shred of caring for other people.

However, it too-often falls into the pop-psych mold of ""Researchers from X tested whether X is X. The results were surprising"" (no citation). The fact that the authors pay all too much credit to Gladwell makes it clear that they haven't woken up to the fact that many readers have grown beyond the enjoyment of such light science and the stratospheric concepts that authors try to wire together. I also wish that this sort of text would focus on one or a few industries or companies because the 'whoah, this applies to farming and web 2.0 companies' type of rhetoric is old and detracts from the storytelling by requiring too much setup and too little examination of each scene.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Although I do wish that there were more time spent on non-Abrahamic religions, there just aren't many other major monotheistic ones...<br/><br/>The account of the creation of the Trinity, which I feel like I've read at least four times in different places, really annoyed me... the unknowable paradox of the Trinity, which I had always thought (back in the dizzle) was something basic to Christianity, seems to be just the haphazard result of lots of stupid bickering. And then now that real Christian philosophy dies, we get an oversimplified, anthropomorphisized, really... backwards attempt to package all facets of God into Jesus. The fact is, belief in Jesus as divine and all-encompassing just isn't 'original' or, really, fundamental to Jesus's teachings.<br/><br/>So says I, at least.

I'm still reading it, to be honest, but I'm really into it. This hits that really cool point in religious studies writing where stereotypes, races, genders, and cultures are all taken correctly into account and seen as real factors on the development of religion. It does get a little intense at points: it's clear that Rosenberg does not identify as an agrarian Baptist southerner, but, given the lack of similar works, it has a responsibility to be a little over-the-top in introducing so many principles and facts of the Southern Baptist tradition which are probably obvious for someone deeply involved, but rather opaque to the outside world.",,,1,,,1,,,Good,,
